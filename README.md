## Introduction

AquaBills utilizes modern web technologies for both the frontend and backend:

### Frontend
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Chakra UI:** A simple, modular and accessible component library for React.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Vite:** A fast frontend build tool that provides an extremely fast development experience.

### Backend
- **Python:** A high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
- **Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **Appwrite:** An open-source backend server for web and mobile developers, written in PHP and running on a Docker environment.

## The Biggest Challenge
During project planning, I thought this would be a simple "in and out" job since i had chakra-ui on my sideðŸ˜‚. I believed I would finish on time, but little did I know, I was just blinded by illusion. When I initially started the project, I had planned to use React.js and Chakra UI for the frontend. However, I then decided, "Why not use TypeScript so I can learn it while doing the project?"

Implementing TypeScript seemed like a great idea at first. I thought it would enhance the project's maintainability and catch errors early on. However, I quickly realized that TypeScript brought its own set of challenges. I wanted to modify code so i can use javascript but i knew that i will be wasting more time and js had its own challanges so i hadt to continue with typescript

Note:
I will post a detailed blog post link about the challenges I faced while doing this project and more.
